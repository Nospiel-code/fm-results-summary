## My process

This is the second challenge that I did following a YouTube video. I like to do this from time to time to see the workflow of experienced frontend developers and learn from their way of solving the problem.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Attribute Selectors

### What I learned

Using the attribute selector **data-spacing** to change the default spacing of a group selector.
Another way to use the data attribute selector is to use different colours like we did here with the **data-item-type**. 
The advantage over custom properties is that they could inherit from the parent element. In this project we use the attribute selector for padding (data-spacing), if we would use custom properties the padding from the parent could affect the child.

The **SVG stroke property** defines the color of the line.

I learned how to use the at-rule **@font-face** to load fonts.

For the **box-shadow** it is usefull to use hsl-color, because it is easy to control the opacity with it.

How to use **locally scoped custom properties**. In this case we used it to define the border radius and the padding. We define a custom property in the parent (result-summary) and use the custom property on the child (results).

How to use **[align item](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Box_alignment_in_grid_layout)** in the grid system. In this case the align-item start.

The **aspect-ratio** is used here so that the circle has a perfect round shape.

How to use the CSS **calc()** function.


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell YouTube Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFAs5d3Yl8&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - As mentioned before, I used a YouTube video to solve this challenge.
- [How to import JSON in JS](https://tutorial.eyehunts.com/json/how-to-import-json-file-in-html/) - In the YouTube video the scores were hardcoded and the JSON file was not used. I find this website and used the code to use the data from the JSON file that was previded from Frontend Mentor.
- [How to use JavaScript Variables in HTML](https://devpractical.com/how-to-use-javascript-variable-in-html/) - After importing the data to JS, this instruction helped me to show the data in HTML.
